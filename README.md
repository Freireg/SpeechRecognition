# SpeechRecognition
Speech Recognition Model embedded in a Raspeberry Pi

This project is heavily inspired by Shawn Hymel youtube's series "[Intro to TensorFlow Lite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-vl9bNY9aI&ab_channel=Digi-Key)"

This project consists in 3 phases:
* Creating the model features
> * Here
* Training the model and convert to tflite extension
* Uploading the model into a RPI and run the script
